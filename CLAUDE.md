## Project

This is an Amazon-style landing page project.

## Code Style & Principles

- Prioritize clear, readable code over performance optimizations.
- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, secure, and efficient code.
- Fully implement all requested functionality — no TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete and thoroughly verified before finishing.
- Include all required imports and use proper naming for key components.
- Be concise. Minimize unnecessary prose.

## Workflow

- Think step-by-step before implementing. Plan the approach before writing code.
- If unsure about the correct answer, say so. Do not guess.
